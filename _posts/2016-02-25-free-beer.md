title: Free as in Beer
comments: true

The old adage about open-source is to think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer"... until now. 

> With DIY Dog we wanted to do something that has never been done before as well as paying tribute to our home-brewing roots. We wanted to take all of our recipes, every single last one, and give them all away for free, to the amazing global home-brewing community.

> So here it is. The keys to our kingdom. Every single BrewDog recipe, ever. So copy them, tear them to pieces, bastardise them, adapt them, but most of all, enjoy them. They are well travelled but with plenty of miles still left on the clock. Just remember to share your brews, and share your results. Sharing is caring.

I think next on my list of homebrews is, "Islay Whisky Aged IPA." Thanks BrewDog!
