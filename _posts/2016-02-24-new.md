title: Huge Boost for Xamarin

Today, [Microsoft bought Xamarin](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/02/24/microsoft-to-acquire-xamarin-and-empower-more-developers-to-build-apps-on-any-device/), a software company whose tools allow you to write cross-platform native mobile apps in C#. 

I say this is a boost for Xamarin because it should greatly drive adoption if it presumably gets bundled in Visual Studio for free, in lieu of the pricey license previously needed for the toolset. 

I was a huge advocate of WPF, XAML, and MVVM coming off winforms. However, with the advent of data-binding on the web with the likes of angular, the death of Silverlight, and the lack of direction for WPF, I'm sad to say XAML is a dying language. Acquiring Xamarin will give it one last dying breath, but this too shall pass. 

Just like TFS [conceded](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2013-jan-30-vso#git%20support) to git, XAML/C# couldn't defeat HTML/JavaScript as seen with [WinRT](https://github.com/winjs/winjs). 

As exciting as this announcement is, I still have my money on HTML and JavaScript (e.g. Ionic and Cordova.)
