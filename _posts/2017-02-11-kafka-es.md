Very nice talk on using Kafka as an event store in a distributed architecture. 

* start from a monolith
  * single build pipeline
  * good for small teams
  * doesn't scale well
* strangler pattern
  * tease out small services
  * monolith becomes a facade that calls into microservices
* microservices
  * clear ownership
  * fast build times
  * independently scalable 
  * allows innovation and new technology 
* Cons
  * latency
  * cascading failure 
  * uptime is based on combined critical service path
* non-essential calls should be asynchronous 
  * decoupling
  * producers don't need to be aware of consumers 
  * define delivery requirements 
  * buffering for slow consumers
* kafka
  * append only
    * fast O(1)
    * LinkedIn sent 800billion/day (2015)
 * broker data persisted to disk
 * topics + partitions
   * balanced or hashed
 * persistence of hours to weeks
 * pulling consumers 
   * save current index
 * immutable log files
 * consumers can pick up where they left off due to upgrades or downtime
