Trying out [Octopage](Octopage - Blogging with Jekyll, Markdown and GitHub pages by Huang Tuo
https://appsto.re/us/rk9UM.i) on my phone. Hoping this will make frequent blogging easier. 

I could have made a simple app to [create new posts](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file) using the github api, but for $1 this will let me focus on the [task at hand]({% post_url 2015-12-27-hello-world %}).
