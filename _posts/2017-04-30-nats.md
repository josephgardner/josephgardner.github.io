When attempting to design microservices on windows, you inevitably want to use a tool that only runs on *nix. This lead me down the path of wanting to run windows and linux containers side-by-side. 

While watching a video on [running a hybrid docker swarm](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/DXPortugal/OSCAMP-Open-Source-Software-powered-by-Bright-Pixel/The-Hybrid-Swarm-Running-Windows-and-Linux-Apps-in-one-Docker-Cluster), the speaker mentioned he was using NATS as a message queue. In a windows container. 

[NATS](https://nats.io) is a highly performant, extremely lightweight, open source messaging system written in Go. 

[NATS streaming](https://nats.io/documentation/streaming/nats-streaming-intro/) adds reliable streaming to NATS core. 

So, if you are in the market for a message queue for your microservices architecture, be sure to give NATS a spin!
