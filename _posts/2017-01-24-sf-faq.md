In [round 8](https://youtu.be/0pafuqwTIJ4) of the Service Fabric Q&A, they announced a "common questions" page to hopefully answer the frequently asked questions they've gotten almost every time.

**Update:** Another gem I became aware of in this session is [Microsoft.Diagnostic.EventFlow](https://github.com/Azure/diagnostics-eventflow/blob/master/README.md) which allows you to log to [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging](https://github.com/Azure/diagnostics-eventflow/blob/master/README.md#microsoftextensionslogging) and have it persist to Elasticsearch (and the ELK stack more specifically.)
