The junk drawer is where obscure cables in my house go to die. My wife got fed up with the tangled mess and put them all in snack bags

Genius? I think so. 

### GitHub Images
I'm also testing out images on this blog. The free app [CodeHub](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codehub-a-client-for-github/id707173885?mt=8) lets you upload images to github issues. I created an [Images](https://github.com/josephgardner/josephgardner.github.io/issues/1) issue where I can easily post images from my phone. Then I just link to them here. No need to commit or push anything. 

I couldn't figure out how to use the new [large file store](https://github.com/blog/1986-announcing-git-large-file-storage-lfs) from my phone, but I'll keep an eye on it. 

How do you post images to your github pages?
